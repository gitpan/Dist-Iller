=head1 SYNOPSIS

  iller new Dist::Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dist::Iller is a L<Dist::Zilla> profile, minter and L<plugin bundle|Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Iller>.

This was inspired by L<Dist::Milla>, which is recommended if you are looking for a straight-forward way to start using L<Dist::Zilla>.

The reason for not just releasing the plugin bundle is the C<iller> command. Together with the profile it initializes a git repository, runs C<dzil build> on it, and then adds the newly created files to the repo. I find that useful.
