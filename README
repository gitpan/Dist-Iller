NAME
    Dist::Iller - Another way to use Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.1002

SYNOPSIS
      iller new Dist::Name

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Iller is a Dist::Zilla profile, minter, Dist::Zilla plugin bundle,
    and Pod::Weaver plugin bundle.

    This was inspired by Dist::Milla, which is recommended if you are
    looking for a straight-forward way to start using Dist::Zilla.

    The reason for not just releasing the plugin bundles is the "iller"
    command. Together with the profile it initializes a git repository, runs
    "dzil build" on it, and then adds the newly created files to the repo. I
    find that useful.
